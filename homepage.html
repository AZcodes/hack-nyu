    <p><h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Khao, a platform for South Asians, intending to educate and replace pre-existing unhealthy nutritional norms with healthy alternatives
        At Khao, we understand the immense value that South Asian food adds into the South Asian culture. It may just be the largest contributor to South Asian culture. 
        Unfortunately, it may also be the leading cause of the plethora of diseases that South Asians know too well; to name a few: Type 2 Diabetes, which can be blamed on the 
        heavy consumption of roti and white rice, High Blood Pressure, the culprit being heavy salt dosages in all foods.</p>  </div>
